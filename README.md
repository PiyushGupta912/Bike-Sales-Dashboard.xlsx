# Bike-Sales-Dashboard.xlsx
This is a project that I have made using Microsoft Excel only.
The dashboard shows sales data for bicycles, broken down by various factors such as:

1. Customer demographics: This includes marital status, education level, and number of cars owned.
2. Income: This is shown as the average income for both male and female customers.
3. Region: The dashboard shows sales data for three regions: Europe, North America, and Pacific.
4. Customer age brackets: This shows the breakdown of customers by age group: Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old.
5. Commute distance: This shows how far customers typically commute to work.

The dashboard also includes some filters that allow the user to see the data for different subsets of customers. For example, the user can filter by marital status, education, or commute distance.
Overall, the function of the dashboard is to provide insights into bicycle sales data and help users understand how different factors are related to bicycle sales. For example, the dashboard shows that middle-aged men with a bachelor's degree and who commute 1-2 miles to work are the most likely to buy a bicycle.

Here are some additional insights that the dashboard reveals:

1. Income may be a factor in bicycle sales: The average income for bicycle customers is relatively high, which suggests that people with more disposable income are more likely to buy a bicycle.
2. Region may also play a role: Sales are highest in Europe, followed by North America and then the Pacific region. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as cultural differences in attitudes towards cycling or differences in the availability of cycling 
   infrastructure.
3. Commute distance could be another factor: Customers who commute shorter distances are more likely to buy a bicycle, which suggests that convenience is a factor in the decision to purchase a bicycle.
